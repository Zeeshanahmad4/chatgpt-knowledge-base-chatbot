# Openai Chatgpt on your own data

I am currently in the process of developing a chatbot that utilizes your personal data. I am already halfway through the project, and I plan to open-source the code soon. It would be greatly appreciated if you could give this repository a star and consider joining my server for collaboration and discussion.


## Here are the technical stacks that I am utilizing to build this chatbot:

- Node.js, Python, MongoDB, and React for the web application
- OpenAI ChatGPT Turbo 3.5 for conversation
- OpenAI Ada model for embedding
- Vectorization for long-term and short-term memory
- Pincones Database for embedding


## Features
- User management system
- Long-term, permanent conversations with the bot
- Custom indexes - use your own files, PDFs, TXT files, websites
- Automatic retry on API errors
- Change and view model parameters such as temp, top\_p, etc. directly
